Just a practice react based task manager web app.
Using Nodejs + Express + Objection.js + SQLite for backend (the task-manager-backend)
Using React + JavaScript + CSS for the frontend.

To be done:
1. FIX HTML FOR LIST
2. FINALLY ADD CSS
3. FIX BACKEND TO A PROPER REST API (Proper CRUD, error handling and printing etc...)


Progress Report:
Please note that due to time constraints (3rd year university student and work) most parts of the website is (at the moment) really rough/draft. The goal behind the practice was to understand Nodejs, express and react as such I quickly built the backend in order to start learning react. The frontend as well is draft thus has no css.

For best example of css and html ask to see (See the Gap project).
